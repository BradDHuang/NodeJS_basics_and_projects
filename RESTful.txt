/*
REST / RESTFUL
• REST (REpresentational State Transfer)

• One of the modern architectural style of web applications
• REST is a set of design criteria
    • not the physical structure (architecture) of the system
• REST is not tied to the ‘Web’ only
    • i.e. doesn’t depend on the mechanics of HTTP
• It is supposed to be ‘stateless’
*/

TERMS
• Resource
    Similar to “Object” in OOP
    
• URI
    A resource must have at least one URI
    No URI -> Not a resource
    
• Flexible data representation

• Uniform interface - CRUD


Notes:
    Sessions are NOT RESTful (i.e. sessions = state)
    Cookies, if used appropriately (for storing client state) are RESTful
    Some server frameworks only support GET/POST forcing one to overload POST requests for PUT/DELETE
    Prefix endpoints with /api, to differentiate from app routes.
    
REST: a mapping between HTTP routes and CRUD.

REST API:
    Web services APIs that adhere to the REST architectural constraints are called REST(ful) APIs.
