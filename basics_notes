Node.js: 
a JavaScript runtime 
built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
// ******
// V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it.
// V8 Written in: C++, JavaScript
// ******

Node.js uses an event-driven, 
non-blocking 
I/O model 
that makes it lightweight and efficient. 
// ******
e.g. of "blocking"
var user1 = getUserSync("123"); // waiting on user1.
console.log("user1", user1);
var user2 = getUserSync("321"); // waiting on user2.
console.log("user2", user2);

e.g. of "non-blocking"
getUser("123", function(user1) { // starting getUser for user1.
    console.log("user1", user1);
}); 
getUser("321", function(user2) { // starting getUser for user2.
    console.log("user2", user2);
});
// ******

Node.js' package ecosystem:
npm (node package manager), 
is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

use "Ctrl + f" // find

argv: 
stands for "argument vector". 
A vector is a one-dimensional array, 
and argv is a one-dimensional array of strings.

Yargs:
helps you build interactive command line tools, 
by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.

    If you're running console.log() from a JS file, 
    this undefined line should not be appended.

    If you're running console.log() from the console itself, it makes sense. 
    This is why: In the console you can type a name of a variable (for example try typing window) 
    and it prints info about it. 
    When you run any void function (like console.log()) from the console, 
    it also prints out info about the return value, undefined in this case.
