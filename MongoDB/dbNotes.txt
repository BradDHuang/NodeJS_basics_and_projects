MySQL (Relational database management system (RDBMS))
• Relational Data Model
    • Object / Table
    • Relationships
        • 1:1, 1:M, M:M
• Storage
    • Binary
• Operations
    • CRUD
• Access
    • GUI (graphical user interface)
    • ODBC (Open Database Connectivity ), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), …
    
MongoDB
• Document Data Model
    • JSON, BSON (Binary JSON)
    // Collection
• Storage
    • Text files
• Operations
    • Search / Read
    • CRUD
• Access
    • same …
   
ACCESSING DATABASE  
DML 
stands for Data Manipulation Language. 
The SQL statements that are in the DML class are INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. ... 

Data Definition Languages (DDL) 
are used to define the database structure. 
Any CREATE, DROP and ALTER commands are examples of DDL SQL statements.

Query

An ORM (Object-relational mapping)
maps between an Object Model and a Relational Database. 
// MySQL is not an ORM, it's a Relational Database, more specifically, a SQL Database.

An ODM (Object Document Mapper)
maps between an Object Model and a Document Database. 

// e.g.
mongoose ODM
// elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js

// mongoose.Schema
Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. 
Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection 
and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.

Models 
are fancy constructors 
compiled from Schema definitions. 
An instance of a model 
is called a document. 
Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database.
// e.g.
    var schema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: 'string', size: 'string' });
    var Tank = mongoose.model('Tank', schema);
    The first argument 
    is the singular name of the collection your model is for. 
    Mongoose automatically looks for the plural version of your model name. 
    // Thus, for the example above, the model Tank is for the tanks collection in the database. 
    The .model() function makes a copy of schema. 
    Make sure that you've added everything you want to schema before calling .model()!

why MongoDB?

because it enables Organizations to build applications 
faster, 
handle highly diverse data types, 
and manage applications more efficiently at scale.

Development is simplified 
as MongoDB documents map naturally to 
modern, object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. 

Using MongoDB 
removes the complex object-relational mapping (ORM) layer 
that translates objects in code to relational tables. 

MongoDB can also be scaled 
within and across multiple distributed data centers, 
providing new levels of availability and scalability 
previously unachievable with relational databases like MySQL. 
// scale with MySQL often requires significant, custom engineering work.

Working with data as flexible JSON documents, 
rather than as rigid rows and columns, 
is proven to help developers move faster.

Documents are natural. 
// Documents represent data in the same way that applications do. 
Documents are flexible. 
// Each document can store data with 
// different attributes from other documents.
Documents make applications fast. 
// With data for an entity stored in a single document, 
// rather than spread across multiple relational tables, 
// the database only needs to read and write to 
// a single place.
